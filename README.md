### Notes

- The yellow tank rapidly deploys mines compared to other mine-deploying tanks.

- The green tank, unlike all other enemy tanks, uses calculated predictive aiming and tends to fire where the player is approaching rather than their current position, able to do so with such calculation accounting for its 2 ricochets.

- The white tank has a special property that it turns invisible as the mission begins. Its tracks remain visible.
